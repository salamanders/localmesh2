### ðŸš€ Algorithm: The "Mandate-and-Verify" Join aka "SlowConenct"

The logic is simple: **guarantee one connection, then try your best to make a second.**

**When a new node (NewNode) joins:**

1. **Mandatory First Connection (Guarantees Connectivity):**
    * NewNode requests the list of all "advertising" nodes (those with **< 5** connections).
    * It picks a random node from the list, OtherNodeA, and sends a connection request.
    * **If the request fails** (because OtherNodeA just filled its last slot in a race condition or
      is having technical issues), NewNode simply requests the list again and picks a *different*
      node.
    * NewNode **must repeat this process until it successfully makes one connection.**

2. **Best-Effort Second Connection (Provides Robustness):**
    * Once connected to OtherNodeA, NewNode *immediately* requests a *fresh* list of advertising
      nodes.  **This is the key: the list must be fresh, only including other peers that advertized
      after the first connection was made. It is worth it to wait for nodes to advertize again,
      rather than to
      use existing advertisements.**
    * It **skips OtherNodeA** from this new list (Never try connecting twice to someone you are
      already connected to).
    * If this new list is empty (meaning OtherNodeA was the last available node), **the algorithm
      pauses for 1 minute and tries again.**
    * If the list is *not* empty, NewNode picks a **random** node, OtherNodeB, and attempts to
      connect.
    * If this request fails (another race condition), it just picks another from the list,
      OtherNodeC, and tries again.
    * It continues this "best-effort" attempt until it lands a second connection. If it runs out of
      targets, (no other nodes are broadcasting that they can accept connections), it waits 1 minute
      before trying again. It resumes this effort any time it is below the 2 node minimum.
    * It is only broadcasting that it is available for inbounnd connections when it falls below
      the 5 active connections goal.

### ðŸ“Š Analysis of This Algorithm

This approach creates a slightly different, but still very effective, network.

* **Chance of Full Connectivity: 100%**
  The "Mandatory First Connection" (Step 1) guarantees this. It is impossible for a new node to fail
  to join the main island. Every node that arrives is, by definition, "chained" to the graph that
  existed before it. You will never have two islands.

* **How It Solves Your Problems:**
    * **No "Saturated Island":** This is still solved. A node only ever initiates 2 connections. It
      never tries to connect to 5 others, so the "6-node saturated clique" can never form.
    * **Handles "Unknown Slots":** The algorithm is resilient. It doesn't *care* if OtherNodeA has 1
      slot or 4. It just tries, and if it fails, it shrugs and tries another. It treats failed
      requests (race conditions) as a minor inconvenience, not a fatal error.

The final 30-node graph will be a single, connected island. The vast majority of nodes will have 2 (
or more) connections, making the network robust. A few nodes, perhaps the last ones to join, might
end up with only 1 connection, but the graph as a whole will be connected.
